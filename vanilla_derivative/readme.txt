These files are partially based off of content from Planetary Annihilation or Planetary Annihilation: TITANS.

Someone on the Union Team may have modified them since then.

All modifications (deviations from the original source files) in here will eventually be under the Union License, but the original source files are not.

From that standpoint, the files in here would need to be jointly licensed by the Union team and PA Inc for arbitrary commercial distribution purposes.
